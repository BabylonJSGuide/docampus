## Grounding the World
At the moment we have a box floating in space. To make the scene more world like lets add ground and think of our box as a building set on the ground.

Adding a ground is simple using

```javascript
const ground = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGround("ground", {width:10, height:10});
```
As we need to create a ground large enough, to put some buildings (boxes) on, the options parameter has two properties set, width in the x direction and height in the z direction. (Yes, we agree, since y is vertical it would make more sense for the properties to be width and depth.)

The immediate thing to note is that  the ground cuts through the middle of the box. This is because when they are created meshes are positioned at the origin.

We need to move the box up half its height using

```javascript
box.position.y = 0.5;  //box created with default size so height is 1
```

Buildings come in varied sizes, positions and orientations and this will be true for the world we are creating.
