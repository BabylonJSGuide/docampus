# Getting Started Introduction
## Introduction 
Welcome to the wonderful 3D world of Babylon.js. Whoever you are, game, app or web creator or just exploring, this is where you start to learning more about Babylon.js and 3D on the web. Whatever your expertise in these areas, from beginner to a seasoned hand or somewhere in between, we are sure you will find something of interest. You will see that there are many ways you can work with Babylon.js. Broadly speaking we group them into three interest areas, all of which, to varying degrees, require a working knowledge of JavaScript. 

1. Developing games or apps for the Web with a focus on coding, using Babylon.js as a 3D extension to Javascript;
2. Designing games or apps for the Web by loading into Babylon.js the beautiful models and environments you have already produced;
3. Enhancing the appeal of website through the use of Babylon.js to display products or information in 3D.

In moving through Getting Started we will touch on each of these ways as we introduce you to the features of Babylon.js and how to work with them. When you have covered all the chapters you will be aware, at a foundation level, of what Babylon.js has to offer you. Then, or even before that, you can use the documentation to increase your depth of knowledge of Babylon.js. One day you will be finding new ways, of your own, to work with Babylon.js and, who knows, start contributing to it.

We use the [Babylon.js Playground](), or just playground, to present examples within the documentation for you to follow, explore and edit.

Now it is time to start learning. Instead of the usual 'Hello World' introduction we will build a simple world, a small village, step by step, demonstrating the features of Babylon.js. The first steps will show you how to use Babylon.js to code a simple model in a scene, to load a model into a scene and how to display the scene or model on the Web. After that, using copies of the model, we will produce the basis of the village and then add more and more items to introduce new features.
